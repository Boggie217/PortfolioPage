                and found that programming <br> is highly compatible with the syntax of language, as well as a great outlet for creativity <br></p>
                <p style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: lighter;margin-bottom: 30px;">-My primary focus is on HTML, CSS Javascript and Python as they're general use and industry recognised<br> but i would appreciate the opportunity to learn
                about backend development, API's, javascript frameworks<br> and cybersecurity.  </p>
